dread about your own projects. Our culture revolves around Open Source—which means everyone gets to see your terrible coding decisions!

super serious about their machine learning!

pressure!                                                                                                                              

If you want to be one of those rebels who “dares” to innovate, come apply and provide your super-duper resume filled with ambitious    
projects and lofty dreams. Don’t worry about the fine print—“experience required” is merely a suggestion!
